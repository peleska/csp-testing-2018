In this paper, new contributions to testing Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
are presented. The focus of these contributions is on the generation of complete, finite
test suites. Test suites are complete if they can guarantee to uncover every 
conformance violation of the system under test (SUT) with respect to a reference model.
Both reference models and implementations are represented as CSP processes. As 
conformance relation, we consider trace equivalence and trace refinement, as well as 
failures equivalence and failures refinement. Complete black-box test suites rely on 
the fact that the SUT's true behaviour is represented by a member of a fault-domain, that is, a collection of CSP processes that may or may not conform to the reference 
model. We define fault domains by bounding the number of excessive states occurring 
in a fault domain member's representation as normalised transition graph, when comparing 
it to the number of states present in the graph of the reference model. This notion
of fault domains is quite close to the way they are defined for finite state machines.
These fault domains guarantee the existence of finite complete test suites.
