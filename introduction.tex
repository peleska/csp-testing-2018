\subsubsection*{Motivation}

Model-based testing (MBT) is an  active research field which  is currently evaluated and integrated into industrial verification  
processes by many companies. This holds particularly for the embedded and cyber-physical systems domain. While MBT is applied in different flavours, we consider the variant 
to be the most effective one, 
where test cases and concrete test data, as well as checkers for the expected results
 are automatically generated from a reference model:
 it guarantees the maximal return of investment for the time and effort invested into creating the test model. The test suites generated in 
 this way, however, usually have different test strength, 
 depending on then generation algorithms applied.
 
For the safety-critical systems domain, test suites with guaranteed fault coverage 
are of particular interest. For black-box testing, these guarantees can only be given 
under certain hypotheses. These hypotheses are usually identified by specifying a \emph{fault domain}; this is a set of models that may or may not conform to the SUT. 
The so-called \emph{complete} test strategies guarantee to uncover very conformance violation of the SUT with respect to a reference model, provided that the true SUT behaviour has been captured by a member of the fault domain. 

Generation methods for complete test suites have been developed for various modelling formalisms. In this paper, we use 
\emph{Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)}~\cite{Hoare:1985:CSP:3921,Roscoe2010}; 
this is 
a mature process-algebraic approach  which has been shown to be well-suited for 
the description of reactive control systems in many publications over almost 5 decades.

\subsubsection*{Contributions}


This paper complements work published by two of the authors 
in~\cite{DBLP:conf/pts/CavalcantiS17}. There, fault domains have been specified 
as collections of processes refining a  ``most general'' fault domain member. With this concept of fault domains, complete test suites may be finite or infinite. While this gives 
important insight into the theory of complete test suites, we are particularly interested
in finite suites when it comes to their practical application.

Therefore, we present a complementary approach to the definition of CSP fault
domains in this paper. To this end, we observe that 
every CSP process can be semantically represented as a 
normalised transition graph, whose edges are labelled by the events the process engages 
in, and whose nodes are labelled by minimal acceptances or, alternatively, 
maximal refusals~\cite{Roscoe:1994:CME:197600}. 
The minimal acceptances express the degree of nondeterminism
that is present in a given CSP process state which is in one-one-correspondence to
a node of the normalised transition graph. 
Inspired by the way that fault-domains are specified for finite state machines (FSMs), 
we define 
them here as the set of CSP processes whose normalised transition graphs do not exceed the
size of the reference model's graph by more than a give constant. 

Our main contributions in this paper are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is proven that for fault domains of the described type, complete test suite 
generation methods can be given for verifying (1) Trace equivalence, (2) trace refinement,
(3) failures equivalence, and (4) failures refinement.

\item We prove that finite complete  test suites can be generated in all 4 cases.

\item We present test suite generation techniques for each of the 4 conformance relations
by translating algorithms originally elaborated for the FSM domain into the CSP world. This 
translation preserves the completeness properties that have previously been established
for the FSM domain
by other authors. 
\end{enumerate}
