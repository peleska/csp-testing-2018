	abstract = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems used in computing science. Examples include first-order logic, equational logic, Horn-clause logic, higher-order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, intuitionistic logic, order-sorted logic, and temporal logic; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. The concept of institution is introduced to formalize the informal notion of “logical system.” The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure “in-the-large”; for example, we can   define language features for building large logical system. This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artificial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third main result gives conditions under which it is sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another. A fourth main result shows how to extend institutions so that their theories may include, in addition  to the original sentences, various kinds of constraint that are useful for defining   abstract data types, including both “data” and “hierarchy” constraints. Further results show how to define institutions that allow sentences and constraints from two or more institutions. All our general results apply to such “duplex” and “multiplex” institutions.},

    abstract = {Several module and class testing techniques have been applied to object-oriented (OO) programs, but researchers have only recently begun developing test criteria that evaluate the use of key OO features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Mutation testing is a powerful testing technique for generating software tests and evaluating the quality of software. However, the cost of mutation testing has traditionally been so high that it cannot be applied without full automated tool support. This paper presents a method to reduce the execution cost of mutation testing for OO programs by using two key technologies, mutant schemata generation (MSG) and bytecode translation. This method adapts the existing MSG method for mutants that change the program behaviour and uses bytecode translation for mutants that change the program structure. A key advantage is in performance: only two compilations are required and both the compilation and execution time for each is greatly reduced. A mutation tool based on the MSG/bytecode translation method has been built and used to measure the speedup over the separate compilation approach. Experimental results show that the MSG/bytecode translation method is about five times faster than separate compilation. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The extended finite state machine ({EFSM)} is a powerful approach for modeling state-based systems. However, testing from {EFSMs} is complicated by the existence of infeasible paths. One important problem is the existence of a transition with a guard that references a counter variable whose value depends on previous transitions. The presence of such transitions in paths often leads to infeasible paths. This paper proposes a novel approach to bypass the counter problem. The proposed approach is evaluated by being used in a genetic algorithm to guide the search for feasible transition paths ({FTPs).}},

This papers presents automatic techniques for partition analysis in state-based specifications, specifically {VDM.} Test domains for individual operations are calculated by reduction of their mathematical description to a Disjunctive Normal Form. Following this, a partition analysis of the system state can be performed which permits the construction of a Finite State Automaton from the specification. This, in turn, can be used to sequence the required tests in a valid and sensible way. A tool has been developed based on the techniques applied to {VDM}, which has been used to develop the examples presented in the paper.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of bounded model checking ({BMC}) for linear temporal logic ({LTL}). We present several efficient encodings that have size linear in the bound. Furthermore, we show how the encodings can be extended to {LTL} with past operators ({PLTL}). The generalised encoding is still of linear size, but cannot detect minimal length counterexamples. By using the virtual unrolling technique minimal length counterexamples can be captured, however, the size of the encoding is quadratic in the specification. We also extend virtual unrolling to Buchi automata, enabling them to accept minimal length counterexamples. Our {BMC} encodings can be made incremental in order to benefit from incremental {SAT} technology. With fairly small modifications the incremental encoding can be further enhanced with a termination check, allowing us to prove properties with {BMC}. Experiments clearly show that our new encodings improve performance of {BMC} considerably, particularly in the case of the incremental encoding, and that they are very competitive for finding bugs. An analysis of the liveness-to-safety transformation reveals many similarities to the {BMC} encodings in this paper. Using the liveness-to-safety translation with {BDD}-based invariant checking results in an efficient method to find shortest counterexamples that complements the {BMC}-based approach.},

		  programming routine as core engine. In contrast to related tools

		  optimizations that arise naturally in the bounded model checking 
		  context, e.g.~isomorphic replication of learned conflict clauses 
		  or tailored decision strategies, and extends them to the hybrid 
		  domain. We demonstrate that those optimizations are crucial to the 
		  performance of the tool.},
